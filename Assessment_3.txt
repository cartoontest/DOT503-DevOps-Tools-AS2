Task Instructions

In Assessment 2, you created an application, added unit tests to it, and wrote build scripts to
automatically compile, build, test, and create deployable package/executable of the application. The
source code along with the unit tests and build scripts are now available in GitHub. In this
assessment you are required to perform the following tasks:

a) Implement Continuous delivery using Jenkins
1. Create a job named ‘DOT503’ in Jenkins to compile, build, test, and create deployable
package/executable of your application from your GitHub repository created in
Assessment 2.

2. Reconfigure the Jenkins job ‘DOT503’ so that whenever any change is made to the
master branch of your repository in GitHub, Jenkins shall automatically start the build
process within two minutes of the update.

3. From Jenkins Web Graphical User Interface (GUI), build the job ‘DOT503.’

4. Fix the failed unit tests. Commit your changed to the master branch of your repository
and push the changes into GitHub.

5. Zip and submit the folder associated with the job ‘DOT503’ which can be found in
Jenkins’ home directory. In Windows operating systems usually C:\Program Files
(x86)\Jenkins\jobs is the Jenkins’ home directory
